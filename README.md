# Coding Club - Submitting R scripts as jobs to Compute Canada clusters
Workshop materials for submitting RScript jobs to Compute Canada 

### Objectives
In this workshop I will guide participants through the following objectives:
1. Installing packages in an interactive session with R in the selected remote cluster
2. Adapt an example RScript to run in the cluster
3. Create and understand the basic elements of a job script job.sh
4. How to transfer data using scp, sftp and globus bewteen the local machine and the cluster
5. Submit the job
6. Track the job, extract the output, evaluate the job performance and interpret the .out file

### Materials
We will work with a subset of the data generated during the first objective of my PhD project. Our article describing the experimental design and full results can be found in https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7783334/
